# batch19exercises

A collection of stubs for additional exercises for Tuitt Coding Bootcamp - Batch 19.

### For easier testing

I encourage you to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node will allow you to run javascript files using the ```node``` command in your terminal.

For example, if you want to run exer1_stacks.js, open a terminal window in your working directory and run:

```
node exer1_stacks.js
```

...and the output should show up in your console.



Happy coding!
